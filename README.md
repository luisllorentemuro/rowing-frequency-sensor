# strokes-per-minute-sensor

The aim of this sensor is to provide the sport of rowing with a tool for calculating statistics during training. Mainly, we are focused on measuring the stroke frequency of the athlete, as well as the rowing boat level inclination. From here on, we will refer to stroke frequency as SPM (strokes per minute), which are calculated using a Hall sensor.

To prevent the SPM from fluctuating excessively throughout the development of the sports activity, a weighting of 3 measurement points will be carried out, that is, the last 3 SPM calculated will be taken and weighed according to weights that will give greater importance to the most recent stroke.

On the other hand, an accelerometer (MPU6050) will be used to check the level of the rowing boat. Through correct positioning and some basic trigonometry, the angle that the boat makes with the water will be deduced.

There will also be a strip made up of 9 LEDs, distributed by colours. Only 3 LEDs, will light up, which will indicate the degree of inclination that the boat has, by moving to the right or left. At the limit, when the 3 LEDs at either end light up, a buzzer will be activated, serving as an audible alarm, in addition to the visual one generated by the LEDs.

Finally, the result of the SPM will be shown to the athlete through an LCD screen.
